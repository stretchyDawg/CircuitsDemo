# CircuitsDemo
Used for demos, features, code examples and tests for the CircuitCheatSheet project. 

## To create a new demo folder:
Since we are using Vite + React for the project's frontend, it is best to use that in future demos for the frontend:
```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
<!-- 'my-react-app' is just a placeholder name -->
```
Clean files are not a priority here, just use this repo as a space to either practice unfamiliar languages or try out implementing features that may be unfamiliar to you. Additionally, aim to have readable code so that other people can figure out what's going on in your code.
