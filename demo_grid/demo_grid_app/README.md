# Grid Demo

Demo showcasing the grid (VERY work in progress) to be used in the project. 

## React Konva
This demo is mainly making use of react-konva:
- Konva website: https://konvajs.org/
- Documentation: https://konvajs.org/docs/react/index.html

React konva is a js library for the \<canvas> element, feel free to read more. Lots of other apps similar to ours use it, which led me to play around with it.
